### React First Project
#### MPOP Reverse II
---
### Introduction
> So since I'm trying to use NodeJS for a year, I try to learn React to proceed to `MERN` stack project. And thank you for a day that I saw a face to face coding that uses ReactJS on our school, and they granted me to learn while they doing it.

---
### Get Started
**Step 1**
> So I do first is to install `npx` on my `npm` so that I can create a new react project. Next is execute this code to your terminal
```Bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
> So the `my-app` is the project name we want to use, you may modify it like sample or anything you want.

**Step 2**
> Next is to check the `App.js`, your `App.js` is the current main file or layout of your react project, so the main setup can be found on  your `index.js`, which uses `ReactDOM`.

### Project Test
**npm start**
> To test this project, there are lists of commands where you can run to your terminal. The first one is `npm start`, this is to start the project. It is autosync, so that you don't need to close or stop the project and re-run again to see the result. Just save the project by pressing `CTRL+S`

**npm test**
> By default, when you run npm test , Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don't often commit the code that doesn't pass the tests. -[Run test](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20when%20you%20run,doesn't%20pass%20the%20tests.)
